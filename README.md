# Vim Norway

Useful re-mappings of Norwegian keyboards to make vims default key-mappings work more smoothly, most notably:

```
,   ->  / (not insert mode)
ø   ->  [
æ   ->  ]
¤   ->  $
S-Ø ->  {
S-Æ ->  }
```

swap between normal keybindings and these with: `yon`.

## Installation

Using `vim-plug`:

```
Plug 'gauteh/vim-norway'
```
