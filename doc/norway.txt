INTRODUCTION                                    *norway*


Useful re-mappings of Norwegian keyboards to make vims default key-mappings
work more smoothly using `langmap` and `keymap`.

USAGE                                           *norway:usage*

By default the mappings are enabled at startup. You can disable this by
setting: >

  let g:norway_enable_at_startup = 0
<

otherwise call `EnableNorway()`, `DisableNorway()` or `ToggleNorway()`. Or use
the mapping `yon` to toggle the mappings.
